**Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to develop a Circle Catcher Game using Python and the Turtle module. This game is designed to test and improve reflexes and hand-eye coordination. Players control a paddle to catch falling circles and avoid triangles that deduct points. The game becomes progressively more challenging with increased speed and added balls as the player's score rises.

This project showcases skills in game development, user interaction, animation, and basic sound integration.

**How to Play**

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.

Catch the falling circles to gain points.

Avoid the falling triangles as they deduct points.

The speed of the falling objects increases as the score increases.

Once 3 balls are missed, the game ends and a Game Over screen is displayed.

Players can click to restart the game and try again.

**Purpose**
This project was created to enhance understanding of game development using Python. It includes:

Real-time animation using the turtle module.

Score and life tracking.

Event-driven programming using keyboard and mouse inputs.

Sound effect integration using platform-specific audio handling.

Displaying interactive instructions and a game over screen.

**Development Environment**
Programming Language: Python 3

Libraries Used:

turtle – For graphics, shapes, and movement.

random – To randomly spawn circles and triangles.

time – To control delays and spawn timing.

platform – To check the OS for sound compatibility.

winsound (Windows only) – For sound effect playback.

Editor Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

**Future Work**
Optimize ball spawn speed to maintain a balanced difficulty curve.

Add background music and additional sound effects for enhanced feedback.

Introduce different levels and new obstacles (e.g., stars or bombs).

Add a high score system that tracks the best performance.

Improve UI with animated menus and better end screens.

Make it mobile-friendly or package it into a desktop executable.
